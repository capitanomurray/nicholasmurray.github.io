#Open for edits

Taking inspiration from Phil Haacks [blog](http://haacked.com/archive/2013/12/02/dr-jekyll-and-mr-haack/) I have added a edit link to my blog posts.

Now every post in my blog has an edit link that lets you edit the blog post directly in the browser and automatically sends me a pull request.

So if you see any mispelling feel free to correct it and send me a pal request.

I have added a Contributors page to list everyone that contributes a fox.

In advance, thanks!!!
